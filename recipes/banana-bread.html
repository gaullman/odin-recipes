        <h3>Ingredients:</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>2-3 medium very ripe bananas, peeled and mashed</li>
                <li>1/3 cupe butter, salted or unsalted, melted</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>

            </ul>   
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prehead the oven to 350 degrees and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth.Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Pour the batter into your loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350 degrees, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. A few crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Banana bread will keep for 4 days at room temperature, wrapped well.</li>
            </ol>
